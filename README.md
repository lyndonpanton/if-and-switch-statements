# if-and-switch-statements
Exercise 2 for the *More C# Programming and Unity* course of the *C# Programming for Unity Game Development* Specialization by the _University of Colorado_ via _Coursera_

## Description

Problem 1 - Create and use a menu using an if statement

Start up Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project named Exercise2. Save the project in a reasonable location on the computer.

Create a menu of choices for your user. It should look like the following (without the extra blank lines):

**************

Menu:

1 - New Game

2 - Load Game

3 - Options

4 - Quit

**************

You should then prompt for and read in the user’s choice as an integer.

Your application should print an appropriate response confirming their choice, such as:

Loading game ...

To summarize, your application should:

·        Display the menu

·        Prompt for and read in the user’s choice

·        Store the choice in an appropriate variable

·        Using an if statement, determine which menu option the user selected, printing an appropriate message for the option selected

·        If the user enters something other than a menu option, print an appropriate message

Problem 2 - Use a switch statement

·        Using a switch statement, determine which menu option the user selected, printing an appropriate message for the option selected

·        If the user enters something other than a menu option, print an appropriate message

Put your switch statement directly below the if statement in the code so that your response to the user looks like it’s repeated.
